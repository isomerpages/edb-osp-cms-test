# 3 reasons why you should consider a career in Singapore’s tech industry


*Singapore is more than just a global financial centre. It is also an innovative technology hub – a miniature Silicon Valley in the heart of Southeast Asia. Blue-chip companies like Amazon and IBM have piloted ground-breaking projects here, and there is strong support for budding tech entrepreneurs to start their businesses. For tech graduates brimming with fresh ideas, there is no shortage of career opportunities: just ask the 1,132,264 young professionals living and working in Singapore today! So if you are keen on working in a tech ecosystem that’s going places, look no further.*

**An ever-growing pool of job opportunities**

Singapore welcomes all looking to become part of our innovation-driven economy. In fact, the IMDA Annual Survey for Infocomm Media Manpower projected a demand for over 28,500 infocomm professionals from 2018 to 2020! If you are interested or skilled in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Cybersecurity and FinTech, you’re bound for success.

**A great environment to grow as an entrepreneur**

There’s no better place to test your new technology ideas than in Singapore, given the growing number of start-up incubator programmes across the island. Whether you work at a prime co-working space, take advantage of valuable mentorships or get access to funding opportunities, you will thrive in a collaborative environment with other fledgling start-ups. Some of the programmes are short-term, lasting several months, while others have a longer horizon. Singapore offers myriad opportunities, no matter what field your start-up is in.

**Convenient and conducive for young professionals**

Located a stone’s throw away from the rest of Southeast Asia, Singapore is the gateway to some of the fastest growing economies in the world. ‘Work hard and play hard’ is the general culture amongst young professionals, with opportunities and long weekends overseas right at their doorstep.  [Non-Singaporeans make up 30 per cent of the country’s population](https://www.population.sg/population-trends/demographics), so it’s no surprise that the relocation process – from finding accommodation to setting up bank accounts – is seamless.
