## Who we are, and what we do

**Who is SGN and what does SGN do?**

The Singapore Global Network (SGN) is a division in the Economic Development Board (EDB). The SGN will broaden and deepen our overseas networks, comprising Overseas Singaporeans as well as friends and fans of Singapore.

**What can I look forward to by connecting with SGN?**

You will be regularly updated with the latest news and developments relating to Singapore and our network of Singaporeans and friends of Singapore living abroad. You will also be invited to attend events, workshops and seminars relevant to you in your area.

<td><strong>Michelle Loh</strong><br/><i>New York</i><br/>Currently based in New York City, Michelle grew up in a typical Singaporean household in Bishan, and craves for simple things like kopi-c dabao whenever she’s away. To her, the sights, sounds and smells of a hawker centre encompass all that she loves about the little red dot. When not catching up with fellow Singaporeans in the US, she can be found Googling for interesting films or podcasts, or embarking on her next culinary adventure.<br /><br/></td>

<td><strong>Shelly Yeo</strong><br/><i>Shanghai</i><br/>From nasi briyani to bak chor mee, mee soto to yong tau foo, this self-proclaimed expert on Singaporean hawker fare believes she knows where the best stalls can be found on our sunny island! When she’s not eating her way through Shanghai with fellow Singaporean kakis, she’s busy working off the calories on her Mobike or playing with her adorable-pillow-stealing kitten – Tiger. Add Shelly on WeChat at OSLChina.<br /></td>

<td><strong>Brenda Tan</strong><br/><i>London</i><br/>Brenda is your bona fide foodie who doesn’t just like to eat. She strives to taste, experience and understand the finer details of the culinary arts. Her interest in food was instilled at an early age by her Peranakan grandmother who, needless to say, was an amazing cook. Constantly surrounded by food at large family feasts, Brenda spent much of her childhood in the kitchen. If you love food too, she could be your new makan kaki!<br /></td>

<td><strong>David Ho</strong><br/><i>San Francisco</i><br/>Whether its training for a marathon, rock-climbing, data analytics or talking about the latest start-up in Silicon Valley, David is always keen to meet and gain new insights. On weekends, David can be found chasing his two boys around, either on foot or on bike and on the few occasions where he is able to catch his breath, he enjoys binging on the latest Netflix series, preferably after a sinful plate of Hainanese chicken rice with lots of chilli sauce (from Maxwell food centre)! Come chill with David by connecting with him on our Facebook page today!<br /></td>

<td style="width: 180px;"><img src="/images/leanne.png" alt="Leanne" /></td>
<td><strong>Leanne Lim</strong><br/><i>Melbourne</i><br/>Leanne gravitates towards the great outdoors and loves going on walks, cycling, and playing tennis and football. In fact, she is capable of holding her own even as the only girl on the futsal pitch. As a lover of arts, she enjoys going to museums and watching Singapore plays. While Leanne loves the coffee in Melbourne, in her humble opinion, nothing can beat a kopi siu dai back home.<br /></td>
