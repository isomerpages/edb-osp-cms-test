![A-Zs of Singapore](/images/kids-resources/a-z-guide-coverimage.png)

S-I-N-G-A-P-O-R-E! What makes our ‘Little Red Dot’ so unique? It’s all in our ‘rojak’ of culture: from places to people, lingo to landmarks, and even our national pastime - food!

Here’s a look at Singapore’s A-Zs! Take time to recall the stories and memories from home as you read through each letter. Be sure to print out our A-Z list [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xOEeKq1AhT3-rEJ78_PVcOHHzN_l5NWC/view?usp=sharing) and put it up on your wall or fridge door for your little ones to look at it, or for you to read through them together.


## <a id="great-zodiac-race"></a>The Great Zodiac Race Colouring Book

![The Great Zodiac Race Colouring Book](/images/kids-resources/great-zodia-race-coverimage.png)

Many are familiar with the 12-year Chinese Zodiac cycle, in which each year is represented by one of 12 animals: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, chicken, dog and pig. This story has its roots in Chinese mythology, where the Jade Emperor – the ruler of all gods – hosted a big race to choose his twelve gate guards. But do you remember how each animal got their spot?

We’ve decided to put a fun, Singaporean twist to this folk tale! Round up your younger family members and friends to hear the story of how the Chinese Zodiac – as we know it – came to be.

When it rains, and you have to stay indoors, it does not mean you have to get bored. Pull out a couple of classic board games like Aeroplane Chess, Chinese Checkers and Snakes & Ladders,  or those old-school card games: Old Maid, Donkey and Happy Family, and before you know it, the sun's out!

If you like something a little more kinesthetically challenging, Five Stones is bound to throw any residual boredom out of the window.

## <a id="snakes-and-ladders"></a>Snakes and Ladders - Singapore Edition!

![SG Snakes and Ladders](/images/kids-resources/snakes-ladders-coverimage.png)

Feeling a little homesick or just want to introduce Singapore to others? This Singaporean version of Snakes and Ladders may just be the solution for you!

This version of Snakes and Ladders works similarly to any other version of the board game. If you’re lucky enough to land on a tile with a ladder, you may climb up the ladder. If you end up on a tile with a snake’s head, you’ll slide down the snake leaving you a little further behind.

However, this game board does come with a slight twist! As you make your way through the board, you may encounter tiles that have Singaporean trivia questions on them. If you get the answer right, you can move your game piece forward. Get it wrong and you’ll find yourself stuck on that square!

What are you waiting for? [Print out](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jpyVXqNEeJKFPKFdgxzicyOV6UsVNiMz/view?usp=sharing) your very own Singaporean Snakes and Ladders here and see who amongst your friends and family is most knowledgeable about Singapore!
